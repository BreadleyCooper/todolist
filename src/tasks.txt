TASKS
//  - make the view by project buttons work.
    - current issue: Something wrong with the logic when you click on a project button, the todos are not clearing and updating. Is it becuase the filter function isnt working or is it something to do with the DOM stuff?
    Why is the filred array empty?

//  - implement local storage
//  - mobile friendly

NOTES for readme
// Issue with form validation - fixed by adding some js logic to check that the form is valid before running the function to toggle the form on or off
// It would be better is the code for rendering the todo list was in a seperate function rather than repeated on the mainContent module
