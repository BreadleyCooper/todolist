//  - implement local storage
            ISSUES:
            Seems theres a problem with retrieving the json and setting the todoarry and projectarrays
            
//  - tidy up the way the todos are structured - more rigid table (grid?)
//  - mobile friendly
//  - add overflow for todo lists and project lists

NOTES for readme
// Issue with form validation - fixed by adding some js logic to check that the form is valid before running the function to toggle the form on or off
// It would be better is the code for rendering the todo list was in a seperate function rather than repeated on the mainContent module
