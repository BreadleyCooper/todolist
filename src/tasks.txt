//  - implement local storage
            ISSUES:
            The Stored values are being grabbed - need to change how projects are displayed in the list of projects.

            Need to array.pop when completing a todo to take it out of local storage

            also need to save the completed arrays to local storage and retrieve them
            
//  - tidy up the way the todos are structured - more rigid table (grid?)
//  - mobile friendly
//  - add overflow for todo lists and project lists

NOTES for readme
// Issue with form validation - fixed by adding some js logic to check that the form is valid before running the function to toggle the form on or off
// It would be better is the code for rendering the todo list was in a seperate function rather than repeated on the mainContent module
